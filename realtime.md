# 2️⃣ Hands-on Project Idea: Real-Time Customer Activity Tracking for an E-commerce Website

### ✅ Scenario:
    
    A website tracks user activity (product clicks, add to cart, purchases).

    This data is processed in real-time and stored in a database.
    
    AI recommends top products based on user behavior.

### ✅ Tech Stack (Choose Cloud Provider):

    Google Cloud: Pub/Sub → Dataflow → BigQuery → Vertex AI

    AWS: Kinesis → AWS Glue → Redshift → SageMaker

    Azure: Event Hubs → Data Factory → Synapse → Azure ML
    
### ✅ Steps to Implement:

1️⃣ Create a mock dataset (JSON/CSV) with user actions.

2️⃣ Use Pub/Sub (GCP) / Kinesis (AWS) / Event Hubs (Azure) to stream data.

3️⃣ Process data using Dataflow / AWS Glue / Data Factory.

4️⃣ Store it in BigQuery / Redshift / Synapse.

5️⃣ Use Vertex AI / SageMaker / Azure ML to generate product recommendations.

6️⃣ Display insights using Looker Studio (GCP) / QuickSight (AWS) / Power BI (Azure).

### ✅ Outcome:

    A real-time data pipeline showing how e-commerce platforms personalize user experiences!

    This is perfect for your interview & client talk.
